# Embedded Patterns

A collection point for example apps and small scale studies of embedded software.

This repository is started as a space to organize solutions to embedded problems, in the form of sample applications.  A planned theme of the work here is to compare solutions to common embeeded problems across high level languages, e.g. C versus Rust.
